# Tweet Sentiment

Let's find out how The Flatiron School is doing on social media. We'll need two APIs to do this: one to get the tweets and another to do what's called [sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis).

## Instructions

  1. Install the [STTwitter](https://github.com/nst/STTwitter) CocoaPod. 
  2. Do the appropriate method call to get all tweets with the query `FlatironSchool`. Use Twitter App Only Authentication. You'll have to get an App Key/Secret [here](https://apps.twitter.com/). If you don't have a Twitter account already, you'll have to make one. 

  3. Once you have the tweets, send each tweet for sentiment analysis via [The Sentiment 140 API](http://help.sentiment140.com/api). This returns a polarity value of 0 for negative, 2 for neutral and 4 for positive. Technically, we are supposed to use the Bulk Classification Service, but it's a bit confusing. I'd just use the Simple Classification Service. For both the `query` and the `text` key you will need to [URL encode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the `NSString` values. You can do this relatively simply with this code:

  ```
  NSString *unescaped = @"RT @RRombom: My answer to How successful are code bootcamps, like Dev Bootcamp and @FlatironSchool at job placement? [ask instructor for the link]";
  NSString *escapedString = [unescaped stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:[NSCharacterSet URLHostAllowedCharacterSet]];
  NSLog(@"escapedString: %@", escapedString);
  ```

  4. Your App should have just a label. When the app loads, it should request all of the tweets mentioning `FlatrionSchool` and then give an average sentiment for the term `FlatironSchool` displayed in the label.
